# Define the variables based on the quantities mentioned in the problem
tickets_whack_a_mole = 32
tickets_skee_ball = 25
tickets_spent_on_hat = 7

# Calculate the total number of tickets won by Tom
total_tickets_won = tickets_whack_a_mole + tickets_skee_ball

# Calculate the number of tickets Tom has left after spending some on the hat
tickets_left = total_tickets_won - tickets_spent_on_hat

# Print the final answer
print(f"Tom has {tickets_left} tickets left.")
