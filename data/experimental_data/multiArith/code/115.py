# Define the initial amount of money Roger had
initial_amount = 29

# Define the amount of money Roger received for his birthday
birthday_money = 20

# Define the amount of money Roger spent on a new game
game_cost = 34

# Calculate the total amount of money after receiving birthday money
total_after_birthday = initial_amount + birthday_money

# Calculate the final amount of money after buying the game
final_amount = total_after_birthday - game_cost

# Print the final answer
