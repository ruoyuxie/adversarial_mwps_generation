# Define variables based on the problem statement
money_mowing_lawns = 9  # dollars made from mowing lawns
money_weed_eating = 18  # dollars made from weed eating
weekly_spending = 3     # dollars spent per week

# Calculate the total money earned
total_money_earned = money_mowing_lawns + money_weed_eating

# Calculate the number of weeks the money would last
weeks_money_will_last = total_money_earned / weekly_spending

# Print the final answer
print(f"The money will last Luke for {weeks_money_will_last} weeks.")
