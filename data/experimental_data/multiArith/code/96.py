# Define the quantities from the problem
number_of_boxes = 4
scarves_per_box = 2
mittens_per_box = 6

# Calculate the total number of scarves
total_scarves = number_of_boxes * scarves_per_box

# Calculate the total number of mittens
total_mittens = number_of_boxes * mittens_per_box

# Calculate the total number of pieces of winter clothing
total_winter_clothing = total_scarves + total_mittens

# Print the final answer
print(f"Lana had a total of {total_winter_clothing} pieces of winter clothing.")
