# Define initial quantities
initial_music_files = 4
initial_video_files = 21

# Total number of files initially
total_files_initially = initial_music_files + initial_video_files

# Number of files deleted
files_deleted = 23

# Calculate the number of files remaining
files_remaining = total_files_initially - files_deleted

# Print the final answer
print("Number of files remaining on the flash drive:", files_remaining)
