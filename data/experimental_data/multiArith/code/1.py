# Define the variables based on the problem statement
books_per_shelf = 6
mystery_shelves = 2
picture_shelves = 6

# Calculate the total number of mystery books
total_mystery_books = books_per_shelf * mystery_shelves

# Calculate the total number of picture books
total_picture_books = books_per_shelf * picture_shelves

# Calculate the total number of books
total_books = total_mystery_books + total_picture_books

# Print the final answer
print(f"Nancy has a total of {total_books} books.")
