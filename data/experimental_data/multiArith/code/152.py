# Define initial variables based on the problem statement
georges_money_initial = 30  # George's initial amount of money
birthday_money = 16        # Money received for his birthday
game_cost = 38             # Cost of the new game

# Calculate the money George has after receiving birthday money
georges_money_after_birthday = georges_money_initial + birthday_money

# Calculate the money George has after buying the new game
georges_money_after_purchase = georges_money_after_birthday - game_cost

# Print the final answer
print("George has now:", georges_money_after_purchase, "dollars")
