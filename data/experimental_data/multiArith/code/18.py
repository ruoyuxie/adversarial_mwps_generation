# Define the variables based on the problem statement
piles_of_quarters = 2
piles_of_dimes = 4
coins_per_pile = 5

# Calculate the total number of quarters and dimes
total_quarters = piles_of_quarters * coins_per_pile
total_dimes = piles_of_dimes * coins_per_pile

# Calculate the total number of coins
total_coins = total_quarters + total_dimes

# Print the final answer
print("Total number of coins:", total_coins)
