# Define the initial quantities
katie_candy = 8
sister_candy = 23

# Combine the candy
total_candy = katie_candy + sister_candy

# Define the amount of candy eaten
candy_eaten = 8

# Calculate the remaining candy
remaining_candy = total_candy - candy_eaten

# Print the final answer
print(f"Katie and her sister have {remaining_candy} pieces of candy left.")
