# Define the variables based on the given problem
total_adventure_books = 32
total_mystery_books = 37
used_books = 16

# Calculate the total number of books bought
total_books_bought = total_adventure_books + total_mystery_books

# Calculate the number of new books by subtracting the used books from the total
new_books_bought = total_books_bought - used_books

# Print the final answer
print(f"Victor bought {new_books_bought} new books.")
