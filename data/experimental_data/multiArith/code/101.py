# Define initial amount of money Luke had in January
initial_amount = 48

# Define the amount Luke spent by March
spent_amount = 11

# Define the amount Luke got from his mom
amount_from_mom = 21

# Calculate the remaining amount after spending
remaining_amount = initial_amount - spent_amount

# Calculate the final amount after receiving money from his mom
final_amount = remaining_amount + amount_from_mom

# Print the final answer
print("Luke would have", final_amount, "dollars.")
