# Define the points per treasure
points_per_treasure = 8

# Define the number of treasures found on the first level
treasures_first_level = 2

# Define the number of treasures found on the second level
treasures_second_level = 2

# Calculate the score for the first level
score_first_level = points_per_treasure * treasures_first_level

# Calculate the score for the second level
score_second_level = points_per_treasure * treasures_second_level

# Calculate the total score
total_score = score_first_level + score_second_level

# Print the final answer
print("Olivia's total score is:", total_score)
