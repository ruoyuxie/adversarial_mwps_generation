# Define the initial number of tickets Dave won
initial_tickets_won = 25

# Define the number of tickets Dave spent on a beanie
tickets_spent_on_beanie = 22

# Calculate the remaining tickets after buying the beanie
remaining_tickets_after_beanie = initial_tickets_won - tickets_spent_on_beanie

# Define the number of tickets Dave won later
additional_tickets_won = 15

# Calculate the total number of tickets Dave has after winning more tickets
total_tickets = remaining_tickets_after_beanie + additional_tickets_won

# Print the final answer
print(f"Dave has {total_tickets} tickets.")
