# Define the quantities mentioned in the problem
number_of_chocolate_boxes = 6
number_of_caramel_boxes = 4
pieces_per_box = 9

# Calculate the total pieces of chocolate candy
total_chocolate_candy = number_of_chocolate_boxes * pieces_per_box

# Calculate the total pieces of caramel candy
total_caramel_candy = number_of_caramel_boxes * pieces_per_box

# Calculate the total amount of candy
total_candy = total_chocolate_candy + total_caramel_candy

# Print the final answer
print("Paul has a total of", total_candy, "pieces of candy.")
