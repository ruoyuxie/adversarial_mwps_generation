# Define the quantities
number_of_country_albums = 2
number_of_pop_albums = 3
songs_per_album = 6

# Calculate the total number of albums
total_albums = number_of_country_albums + number_of_pop_albums

# Calculate the total number of songs
total_songs = total_albums * songs_per_album

# Print the final answer
print(f"Faye bought a total of {total_songs} songs.")
