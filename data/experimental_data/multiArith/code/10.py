# Define the initial number of math and science problems
math_problems = 18
science_problems = 11

# Calculate the total number of problems Gwen had initially
total_problems_initially = math_problems + science_problems

# Define the number of problems Gwen finished at school
problems_finished_at_school = 24

# Calculate the number of problems Gwen has left for homework
problems_left_for_homework = total_problems_initially - problems_finished_at_school

# Print the final answer
print("Gwen has", problems_left_for_homework, "problems left for homework.")
