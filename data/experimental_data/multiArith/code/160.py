# Define the variables for the quantities mentioned in the problem
number_of_tulips = 4
number_of_roses = 11

# Calculate the total number of flowers picked by Janet
total_flowers_picked = number_of_tulips + number_of_roses

# Define the number of flowers used to make the bouquets
flowers_used_for_bouquets = 11

# Calculate the number of extra flowers Janet picked
extra_flowers = total_flowers_picked - flowers_used_for_bouquets

# Print the final answer
print(f"Janet picked {extra_flowers} extra flowers.")
