# Define the quantities given in the problem
number_of_chocolate_boxes = 7
number_of_caramel_boxes = 3
pieces_per_box = 8

# Calculate the total number of pieces for chocolate and caramel
total_chocolate_pieces = number_of_chocolate_boxes * pieces_per_box
total_caramel_pieces = number_of_caramel_boxes * pieces_per_box

# Calculate the total amount of candy
total_candy = total_chocolate_pieces + total_caramel_pieces

# Print the final answer
print(f"Cody has a total of {total_candy} pieces of candy.")
