# Define the quantities
number_of_chairs = 2
number_of_tables = 2
time_per_piece = 8  # minutes

# Calculate the total time spent
total_pieces = number_of_chairs + number_of_tables
total_time_spent = total_pieces * time_per_piece

# Print the final answer
print(f"Maria took {total_time_spent} minutes to finish assembling the furniture.")
