# Define the initial quantities
green_towels = 40
white_towels = 44

# Calculate the total number of towels Maria bought
total_towels = green_towels + white_towels

# Define the number of towels given to her mother
towels_given_to_mother = 65

# Calculate the number of towels Maria ended up with
towels_left_with_maria = total_towels - towels_given_to_mother

# Print the final answer
print("Maria ended up with", towels_left_with_maria, "towels.")
