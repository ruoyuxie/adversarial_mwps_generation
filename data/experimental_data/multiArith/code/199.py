# Define the variables
haley_carrots = 39
mom_carrots = 38
good_carrots = 64

# Calculate the total number of carrots picked
total_carrots = haley_carrots + mom_carrots

# Calculate the number of bad carrots
bad_carrots = total_carrots - good_carrots

# Print the final answer
print(f"The number of bad carrots is: {bad_carrots}")
