# Define initial variables based on the problem statement
initial_tickets_won = 49
cost_of_beanie = 25
additional_tickets_won = 6

# Calculate the number of tickets left after buying the beanie
tickets_after_purchase = initial_tickets_won - cost_of_beanie

# Calculate the total number of tickets after winning more
total_tickets = tickets_after_purchase + additional_tickets_won

# Print the final answer
print("Cody has", total_tickets, "tickets.")
