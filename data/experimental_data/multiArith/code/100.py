# Define the variables for the quantities mentioned in the problem
short_sleeve_shirts = 40
long_sleeve_shirts = 23
washed_before_school = 29

# Calculate the total number of shirts Sam had to wash
total_shirts = short_sleeve_shirts + long_sleeve_shirts

# Calculate the number of shirts Sam did not wash before school started
unwashed_shirts = total_shirts - washed_before_school

# Print the final answer
print(f"Sam did not wash {unwashed_shirts} shirts before school started.")
