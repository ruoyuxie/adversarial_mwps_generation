# Define the variables for the quantities mentioned in the problem
total_math_problems = 43
total_science_problems = 12
problems_finished_at_school = 44

# Calculate the total number of problems Paige had for homework
total_homework_problems = total_math_problems + total_science_problems

# Calculate the number of problems Paige had left to do for homework
problems_left_for_homework = total_homework_problems - problems_finished_at_school

# Print the final answer
print("Paige has", problems_left_for_homework, "problems left to do for homework.")
