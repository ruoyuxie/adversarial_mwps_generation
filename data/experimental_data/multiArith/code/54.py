# Define the variables
math_problems = 18
spelling_problems = 6
problems_per_hour = 4

# Calculate the total number of problems
total_problems = math_problems + spelling_problems

# Calculate the time it will take to finish all the problems
time_to_finish = total_problems / problems_per_hour

# Print the final answer
print("It will take Amy", time_to_finish, "hours to finish all the problems.")
