# Define variables for the quantities mentioned in the problem
new_players = 2
returning_players = 6

# Calculate the total number of players
total_players = new_players + returning_players

# Define the number of players per group
players_per_group = 4

# Calculate the number of groups
number_of_groups = total_players // players_per_group

# Print the final answer
print("The number of groups would be:", number_of_groups)
