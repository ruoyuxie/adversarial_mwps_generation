# Define variables based on the problem statement
spring_earnings = 4  # dollars earned in spring
summer_earnings = 50  # dollars earned in summer
expenses = 4  # dollars spent on supplies

# Calculate the total earnings by adding spring and summer earnings
total_earnings = spring_earnings + summer_earnings

# Calculate the final amount of money Kaleb ended up with after expenses
final_amount = total_earnings - expenses

# Print the final answer
print("Kaleb ended up with", final_amount, "dollars.")
