# Define the cost of each flower
cost_per_flower = 8

# Define the number of roses and daisies Vanessa bought
number_of_roses = 3
number_of_daisies = 3

# Calculate the total cost for roses
total_cost_roses = cost_per_flower * number_of_roses

# Calculate the total cost for daisies
total_cost_daisies = cost_per_flower * number_of_daisies

# Calculate the total amount spent by Vanessa
total_amount_spent = total_cost_roses + total_cost_daisies

# Print the final answer
print("Vanessa spent a total of", total_amount_spent, "dollars.")
