# Define the variables for the quantities mentioned in the problem
short_sleeve_shirts = 39
long_sleeve_shirts = 47
washed_before_school = 20

# Calculate the total number of shirts Oliver had to wash
total_shirts_to_wash = short_sleeve_shirts + long_sleeve_shirts

# Calculate the number of shirts Oliver did not wash before school started
shirts_not_washed = total_shirts_to_wash - washed_before_school

# Print the final answer
print(f"Oliver did not wash {shirts_not_washed} shirts before school started.")
