# Define initial variables based on the problem statement
initial_tickets_won = 9
tickets_spent_on_beanie = 4
additional_tickets_won = 4

# Calculate the number of tickets after spending on the beanie
tickets_after_spending = initial_tickets_won - tickets_spent_on_beanie

# Calculate the final number of tickets after winning more tickets
final_ticket_count = tickets_after_spending + additional_tickets_won

# Print the final answer
print(f"Edward would have {final_ticket_count} tickets.")
