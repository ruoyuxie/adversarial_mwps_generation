# Define the cost of one trick deck
cost_per_deck = 9

# Define the number of decks Edward bought
edward_decks = 4

# Define the number of decks Edward's friend bought
friend_decks = 4

# Calculate the total cost for Edward
edward_total_cost = edward_decks * cost_per_deck

# Calculate the total cost for Edward's friend
friend_total_cost = friend_decks * cost_per_deck

# Calculate the combined total cost
total_cost = edward_total_cost + friend_total_cost

# Print the final answer
print("Total amount spent:", total_cost)
