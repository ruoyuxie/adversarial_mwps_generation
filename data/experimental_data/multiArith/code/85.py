# Define initial variables based on the problem statement
initial_bottles = 14
drank_bottles = 8
bought_bottles = 45

# Calculate the remaining bottles after Maria drank some
remaining_bottles = initial_bottles - drank_bottles

# Calculate the total bottles after Maria bought more
total_bottles = remaining_bottles + bought_bottles

# Print the final answer
print(f"Maria would have {total_bottles} bottles of water.")
