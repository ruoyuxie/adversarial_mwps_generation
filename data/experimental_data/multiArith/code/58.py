# Define the variables based on the given problem
pages_of_math_homework = 7
pages_of_reading_homework = 3
problems_per_page = 9

# Calculate the total number of math problems
total_math_problems = pages_of_math_homework * problems_per_page

# Calculate the total number of reading problems
total_reading_problems = pages_of_reading_homework * problems_per_page

# Calculate the total number of problems
total_problems = total_math_problems + total_reading_problems

# Print the final answer
print(f"Katie had to complete a total of {total_problems} problems.")
