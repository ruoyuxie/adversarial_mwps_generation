# Define the variables
total_members = 9
absent_members = 3
points_per_present_member = 2

# Calculate the number of members that showed up
present_members = total_members - absent_members

# Calculate the total points scored
total_points = present_members * points_per_present_member

# Print the final answer
print("Total points scored:", total_points)
