# Define the variables
books_per_shelf = 7
mystery_shelves = 8
picture_shelves = 2

# Calculate the total number of books for mystery shelves
mystery_books = books_per_shelf * mystery_shelves

# Calculate the total number of books for picture shelves
picture_books = books_per_shelf * picture_shelves

# Calculate the total number of books
total_books = mystery_books + picture_books

# Print the final answer
print("Megan has a total of", total_books, "books.")
