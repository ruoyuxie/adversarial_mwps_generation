# Define the quantities
number_of_adults = 2
number_of_children = 5
cost_per_meal = 8

# Calculate the total number of meals
total_meals = number_of_adults + number_of_children

# Calculate the total cost of the meals
total_cost = total_meals * cost_per_meal

# Print the final answer
print("The total bill is:", total_cost)
