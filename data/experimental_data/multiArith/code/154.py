# Define the variables
cost_per_bar = 6  # cost of each chocolate bar
total_bars = 13  # total number of bars in the box
bars_left = 6  # number of bars left unsold

# Calculate the number of bars sold
bars_sold = total_bars - bars_left

# Calculate the total money made from selling the bars
money_made = bars_sold * cost_per_bar

# Print the final answer
print("Zoe would have made $", money_made)
