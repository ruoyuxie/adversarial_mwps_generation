# Define the variables
cost_per_bar = 3  # Cost of each chocolate bar in dollars
total_bars = 7    # Total number of bars in the box
bars_sold = total_bars - 4  # Number of bars sold by Olivia

# Calculate the total money made by Olivia
money_made = bars_sold * cost_per_bar

# Print the final answer
print("Olivia would have made $", money_made)
