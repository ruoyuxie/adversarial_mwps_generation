# Define the cost of one trick deck
cost_per_deck = 8

# Define the number of decks Victor bought
victor_decks = 6

# Define the number of decks Victor's friend bought
friend_decks = 2

# Calculate the total cost for Victor
victor_total_cost = victor_decks * cost_per_deck

# Calculate the total cost for Victor's friend
friend_total_cost = friend_decks * cost_per_deck

# Calculate the combined total cost
total_cost = victor_total_cost + friend_total_cost

# Print the final answer
print("Total amount spent:", total_cost)
