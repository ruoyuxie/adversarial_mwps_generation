# Define initial variables
initial_books = 34
books_sold = 17
books_bought = 7

# Calculate the number of books after selling
books_after_selling = initial_books - books_sold

# Calculate the final number of books after buying new ones
final_books = books_after_selling + books_bought

# Print the final answer
print(f"Kaleb would have {final_books} books.")
