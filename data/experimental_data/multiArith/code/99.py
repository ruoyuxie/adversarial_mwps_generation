# Define initial variables based on the problem statement
initial_cupcakes = 30
cupcakes_sold = 9
additional_cupcakes = 28

# Calculate the remaining cupcakes after selling some
remaining_cupcakes = initial_cupcakes - cupcakes_sold

# Calculate the total number of cupcakes after making more
total_cupcakes = remaining_cupcakes + additional_cupcakes

# Print the final answer
print(f"Carol would have {total_cupcakes} cupcakes.")
