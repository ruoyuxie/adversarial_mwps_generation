# Define the variables for the quantities mentioned in the problem
short_sleeve_shirts = 29
long_sleeve_shirts = 11
washed_before_school = 35

# Calculate the total number of shirts Dave had to wash
total_shirts = short_sleeve_shirts + long_sleeve_shirts

# Calculate the number of shirts Dave did not wash
unwashed_shirts = total_shirts - washed_before_school

# Print the final answer
print(f"Dave did not wash {unwashed_shirts} shirts before school.")
