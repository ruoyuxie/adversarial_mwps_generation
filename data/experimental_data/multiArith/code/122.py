# Define the variables
total_boxes_bought = 7
boxes_given_away = 3
pieces_per_box = 4

# Calculate the number of boxes Will has left
boxes_left = total_boxes_bought - boxes_given_away

# Calculate the total number of pieces Will has
total_pieces_left = boxes_left * pieces_per_box

# Print the final answer
print("Will still has", total_pieces_left, "pieces of chocolate candy.")
