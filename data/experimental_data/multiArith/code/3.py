# Define the variables
cupcakes_baked = 41
cookies_baked = 31
pastries_left = 32

# Calculate the total number of pastries baked
total_pastries_baked = cupcakes_baked + cookies_baked

# Calculate the number of pastries sold
pastries_sold = total_pastries_baked - pastries_left

# Print the final answer
print(f"Wendy sold {pastries_sold} pastries.")
