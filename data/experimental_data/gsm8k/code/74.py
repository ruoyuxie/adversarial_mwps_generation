# Define variables
cost_of_first_shirt = 15  # The cost of the first shirt in dollars
difference_in_cost = 6    # The first shirt costs $6 more than the second shirt

# Calculate the cost of the second shirt
cost_of_second_shirt = cost_of_first_shirt - difference_in_cost

# Calculate the total cost of both shirts
total_cost = cost_of_first_shirt + cost_of_second_shirt

# Print the final answer
print("The total cost of the shirts is:", total_cost)
