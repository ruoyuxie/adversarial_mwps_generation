# Define the variables
number_of_packs = 3  # James buys 3 packs of candy
bill_paid = 20       # He pays with a $20 bill
change_received = 11 # He gets $11 change

# Calculate the total cost of the candy packs
total_cost = bill_paid - change_received

# Calculate the cost of each pack of candy
cost_per_pack = total_cost / number_of_packs

# Print the final answer
print("Each pack of candy cost:", cost_per_pack)
