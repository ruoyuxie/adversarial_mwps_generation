# Define the cost of a black and white drawing
bw_drawing_cost = 160

# Calculate the additional cost for color, which is 50% more expensive
color_additional_cost = bw_drawing_cost * 0.5

# Calculate the total cost for the color drawing
color_drawing_cost = bw_drawing_cost + color_additional_cost

# Print the final answer
print(f"John paid ${color_drawing_cost} for the color drawing.")
