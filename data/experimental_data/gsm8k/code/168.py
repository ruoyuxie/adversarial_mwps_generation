# Define variables for the quantities mentioned in the problem
tickets_to_romance_movie = 25  # Number of tickets sold to the romance movie

# According to the problem, the theater sold 18 more than three times the number of tickets to the horror movie
# as it did to the romance movie. We can represent this relationship with the following equation:
# tickets_to_horror_movie = 3 * tickets_to_romance_movie + 18

# Calculate the number of tickets sold to the horror movie using the equation
tickets_to_horror_movie = 3 * tickets_to_romance_movie + 18

# Print the final answer
print(f"The movie theater sold {tickets_to_horror_movie} tickets to the horror movie.")
