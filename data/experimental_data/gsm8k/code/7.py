# Define the height of the first rocket
height_first_rocket = 500  # in feet

# The second rocket can travel twice as high as the first one
height_second_rocket = 2 * height_first_rocket

# Calculate the combined height of the two rockets
combined_height = height_first_rocket + height_second_rocket

# Print the final answer
print("The combined height of the two rockets is:", combined_height, "ft")
