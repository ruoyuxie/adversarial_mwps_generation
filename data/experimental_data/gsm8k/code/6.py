# Define the cost of admission for adults and children
cost_adult = 12
cost_child = 10

# Define the total cost for 1 adult and 1 child
total_cost = cost_adult + cost_child

# Define the amount of change received
change_received = 8

# Calculate the amount of money given to the cashier
# We know that the money given is the total cost plus the change received
money_given = total_cost + change_received

# Print the final answer
print(f"Brittany's mom gave the cashier ${money_given}.")

# Output should be: Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.
