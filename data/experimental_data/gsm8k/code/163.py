# Define variables
hours_per_day = 2       # Tom rents the helicopter for 2 hours a day
days = 3                # Tom rents the helicopter for 3 days
cost_per_hour = 75      # The cost to rent the helicopter is $75 per hour

# Calculate the total hours Tom rents the helicopter
total_hours = hours_per_day * days

# Calculate the total cost of renting the helicopter
total_cost = total_hours * cost_per_hour

# Print the final answer
print("Tom paid a total of $", total_cost)
