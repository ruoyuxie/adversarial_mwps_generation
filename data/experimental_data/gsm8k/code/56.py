# Define the variables
cost_price_per_bag = 4  # Cost price of one bag of popcorn
selling_price_per_bag = 8  # Selling price of one bag of popcorn
number_of_bags_sold = 30  # Number of bags John sells

# Calculate the profit per bag
profit_per_bag = selling_price_per_bag - cost_price_per_bag

# Calculate the total profit for all bags sold
total_profit = profit_per_bag * number_of_bags_sold

# Print the final answer
print("John's total profit by selling 30 bags of popcorn is $", total_profit)
