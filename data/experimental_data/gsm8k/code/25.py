# Define the variables based on the given problem
total_candy_bars = 12
snickers_count = 3
mars_bars_count = 2

# Calculate the number of Butterfingers by subtracting the count of Snickers and Mars bars from the total
butterfingers_count = total_candy_bars - snickers_count - mars_bars_count

# Print the final answer
print(f"Mark has {butterfingers_count} Butterfingers.")
