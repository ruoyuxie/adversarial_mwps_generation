# Define the quantities of flour Sarah buys
rye_flour = 5          # pounds of rye flour
whole_wheat_bread_flour = 10  # pounds of whole-wheat bread flour
chickpea_flour = 3     # pounds of chickpea flour

# Define the quantity of flour Sarah already had
whole_wheat_pastry_flour = 2   # pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour

# Calculate the total amount of flour Sarah now has
total_flour = rye_flour + whole_wheat_bread_flour + chickpea_flour + whole_wheat_pastry_flour

# Print the final answer
print("Sarah now has", total_flour, "pounds of flour.")
