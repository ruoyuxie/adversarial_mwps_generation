# Define the variables
kylie_stamps = 34
nelly_more_stamps = 44

# Calculate the number of stamps Nelly has
nelly_stamps = kylie_stamps + nelly_more_stamps

# Calculate the total number of stamps they have together
total_stamps = kylie_stamps + nelly_stamps

# Print the final answer
print("Kylie and Nelly have together:", total_stamps)
