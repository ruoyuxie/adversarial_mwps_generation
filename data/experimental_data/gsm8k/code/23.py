# Define the initial amount of money Agatha has
total_money = 60

# Define the cost of the bike frame
cost_of_frame = 15

# Define the cost of the front wheel
cost_of_front_wheel = 25

# Calculate the money spent so far
money_spent = cost_of_frame + cost_of_front_wheel

# Calculate the remaining money Agatha has to spend on a seat and handlebar tape
remaining_money = total_money - money_spent

# Print the final answer
print("Agatha has", remaining_money, "dollars left to spend on a seat and handlebar tape.")
