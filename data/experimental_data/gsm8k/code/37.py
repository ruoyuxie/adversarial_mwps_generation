# Define the variables based on the problem statement
jess_doubles = 40  # Jess has 40 doubles baseball cards

# According to the problem, Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob
# Let's denote the number of doubles Rob has as rob_doubles
# Therefore, we can write the equation: jess_doubles = 5 * rob_doubles

# We can solve for rob_doubles by dividing jess_doubles by 5
rob_doubles = jess_doubles / 5

# The problem also states that one third of Rob's cards are doubles
# Let's denote the total number of Rob's cards as rob_total_cards
# We can write the equation: rob_doubles = (1/3) * rob_total_cards

# We can solve for rob_total_cards by multiplying rob_doubles by 3
rob_total_cards = rob_doubles * 3

# Print the final answer
print(f"Rob has {int(rob_total_cards)} baseball cards.")
