# Define the variables
cost_per_frame = 3  # cost of one photograph frame
number_of_frames = 3  # number of frames bought
total_cost = cost_per_frame * number_of_frames  # total cost of frames

# Amount paid by Sally
amount_paid = 20  # Sally paid with a $20 bill

# Calculate the change Sally should get
change = amount_paid - total_cost

# Print the final answer
print("Sally should get $" + str(change) + " in change.")
