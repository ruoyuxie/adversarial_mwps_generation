# Define the variables
dozens_of_boxes = 5  # James has 5 dozen boxes
matches_per_box = 20  # Each box contains 20 matches

# Calculate the total number of boxes
total_boxes = dozens_of_boxes * 12  # There are 12 boxes in a dozen

# Calculate the total number of matches
total_matches = total_boxes * matches_per_box

# Print the final answer
print(f"James has {total_matches} matches.")
