# Define the number of books Megan has read
megan_books = 32

# Calculate the number of books Kelcie has read (1/4 of Megan's books)
kelcie_books = megan_books / 4

# Calculate the number of books Greg has read (9 more than twice Kelcie's books)
greg_books = (2 * kelcie_books) + 9

# Calculate the total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg
total_books = megan_books + kelcie_books + greg_books

# Print the final answer
print(f"The total number of books read by Megan, Kelcie, and Greg is: {int(total_books)}")
