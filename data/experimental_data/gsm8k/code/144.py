# Define the variables
chenny_age = 10  # Chenny's age
alyana_age_difference = 4  # Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny
anne_age_difference = 2  # Anne is 2 years older than Alyana

# Calculate Alyana's age
alyana_age = chenny_age - alyana_age_difference

# Calculate Anne's age
anne_age = alyana_age + anne_age_difference

# Print the final answer
print("Anne is", anne_age, "years old.")
