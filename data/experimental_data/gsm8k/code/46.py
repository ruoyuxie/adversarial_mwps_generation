# Define the variables
chicken_sausages = 38
additional_fish_sausages = 6

# Calculate the number of fish sausages
fish_sausages = chicken_sausages + additional_fish_sausages

# Calculate the total number of sausages
total_sausages = chicken_sausages + fish_sausages

# Print the final answer
print("Dylan bought a total of", total_sausages, "sausages.")
