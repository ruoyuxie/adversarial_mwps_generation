# Define the quantities mentioned in the problem
white_pebbles = 20
red_pebbles = white_pebbles / 2  # Half as many red pebbles as white pebbles

# Calculate the total number of pebbles
total_pebbles = white_pebbles + red_pebbles

# Print the final answer
print(f"Nadine has a total of {int(total_pebbles)} pebbles.")
