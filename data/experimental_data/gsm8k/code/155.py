# Define the number of cards the boy has
boy_cards = 5

# His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does
brother_cards = boy_cards - 3

# Calculate the total number of cards they have together
total_cards = boy_cards + brother_cards

# Print the final answer
print("Together, they have", total_cards, "cards.")
