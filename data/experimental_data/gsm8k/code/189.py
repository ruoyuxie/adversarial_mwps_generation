# Define the total number of kids in the junior prom
total_kids = 140

# Calculate the number of dancers, which is a fourth of the total kids
dancers = total_kids // 4

# Define the number of dancers who danced the slow dance
slow_dancers = 25

# Calculate the number of dancers who did not slow dance
non_slow_dancers = dancers - slow_dancers

# Print the final answer
print("The number of dancer students who did not slow dance is:", non_slow_dancers)
