# Define the variable for the number of classes Kelvin has
kelvin_classes = 90

# Grant has four times as many vacations as Kelvin has classes
grant_vacations = 4 * kelvin_classes

# Calculate the total number of vacations and classes they have altogether
total_vacations_and_classes = grant_vacations + kelvin_classes

# Print the final answer
print("Grant and Kelvin have a total of", total_vacations_and_classes, "vacations and classes altogether.")
