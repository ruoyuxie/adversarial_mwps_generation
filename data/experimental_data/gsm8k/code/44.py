# Define the initial amount of money Raul had
initial_amount = 87

# Define the cost of each comic
cost_per_comic = 4

# Define the number of comics Raul bought
number_of_comics = 8

# Calculate the total cost of the comics
total_cost = cost_per_comic * number_of_comics

# Calculate the amount of money Raul has left
money_left = initial_amount - total_cost

# Print the final answer
print("Raul has $" + str(money_left) + " left after buying the comics.")
