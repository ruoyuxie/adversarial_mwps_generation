# Define variables
age_when_he_was_three = 3  # Age of Mikail when he was three years old
multiplier = 3  # Mikail will be 3 times older than when he was three

# Calculate Mikail's age on his next birthday
age_on_next_birthday = age_when_he_was_three * multiplier

# Define the amount of money given per year of age
money_per_year = 5

# Calculate the total amount of money Mikail's parents will give him
total_money_gift = age_on_next_birthday * money_per_year

# Print the final answer
print("Mikail's parents will give him $", total_money_gift, " on his birthday.", sep='')

# Output should be: Mikail's parents will give him $45 on his birthday.
