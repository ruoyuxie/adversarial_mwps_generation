# Define the initial speed in skips per minute
initial_speed = 70  # skips per minute

# Jan doubles her speed after training
doubled_speed = initial_speed * 2  # skips per minute

# Define the duration of the competition in minutes
duration_minutes = 5  # minutes

# Calculate the total number of skips Jan does in the competition
total_skips = doubled_speed * duration_minutes

# Print the final answer
print(f"Jan does {total_skips} skips in {duration_minutes} minutes.")
