# Define the initial amount of money Joe has saved for the trip
total_savings = 6000

# Define the costs of the different expenses
flight_cost = 1200
hotel_cost = 800
food_cost = 3000

# Calculate the total expenses
total_expenses = flight_cost + hotel_cost + food_cost

# Calculate the remaining amount of money after all expenses
money_left = total_savings - total_expenses

# Print the final answer
print("Joe has ${} left after all the expenses for his trip to Australia.".format(money_left))
