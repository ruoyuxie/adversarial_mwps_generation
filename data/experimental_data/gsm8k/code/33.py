# Define the variables based on the problem statement
fred_stickers = 18  # Fred's number of stickers
george_stickers_difference = 6  # George has 6 fewer stickers than Fred

# Calculate the number of stickers George has
george_stickers = fred_stickers - george_stickers_difference

# Jerry has three times as many stickers as George
jerry_stickers_multiplier = 3

# Calculate the number of stickers Jerry has
jerry_stickers = george_stickers * jerry_stickers_multiplier

# Print the final answer
print(f"Jerry has {jerry_stickers} stickers.")
