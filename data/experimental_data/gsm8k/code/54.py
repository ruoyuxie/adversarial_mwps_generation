# Define the variables based on the given problem
hours_spent_researching = 10
hours_spent_writing_proposal = 2
total_available_hours = 20

# Calculate the hours spent on research and writing the proposal
total_hours_spent = hours_spent_researching + hours_spent_writing_proposal

# Calculate the remaining hours for writing the report
hours_left_for_report = total_available_hours - total_hours_spent

# Print the final answer
print(f"Jenny has {hours_left_for_report} hours left to write her report.")
