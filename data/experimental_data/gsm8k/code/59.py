# Define the variables
cost_per_sandwich = 5  # Cost of one sandwich in dollars
number_of_sandwiches = 3  # Number of sandwiches ordered
payment = 20  # Amount paid in dollars

# Calculate the total cost of the sandwiches
total_cost = cost_per_sandwich * number_of_sandwiches

# Calculate the change to be returned
change = payment - total_cost

# Print the final answer
print("Jack gets $" + str(change) + " in change.")
