# Define the variables based on the given problem
cost_of_frame = 15  # dollars
cost_of_front_wheel = 25  # dollars
remaining_money_for_seat_and_tape = 20  # dollars

# Calculate the total amount Agatha had initially
# We add the costs of the frame, front wheel, and the remaining money
initial_money = cost_of_frame + cost_of_front_wheel + remaining_money_for_seat_and_tape

# Print the final answer
print(f"Agatha had ${initial_money} at first.")
