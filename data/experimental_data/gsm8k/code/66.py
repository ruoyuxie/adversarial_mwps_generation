# Define the initial number of stamps in Parker's scrapbook
parker_stamps = 18

# Define the total number of stamps Addie has
addie_stamps = 72

# Calculate one fourth of Addie's stamps
addie_stamps_to_give = addie_stamps // 4

# Add the stamps Addie put in Parker's scrapbook to Parker's current number of stamps
parker_stamps_after_addie = parker_stamps + addie_stamps_to_give

# Print the final answer
print(f"Parker now has {parker_stamps_after_addie} stamps in his scrapbook.")
