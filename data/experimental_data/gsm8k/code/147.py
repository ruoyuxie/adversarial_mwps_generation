# Define the number of apples Martha has
martha_apples = 68

# Tim has 30 less apples than Martha
tim_apples = martha_apples - 30

# Harry has half as many apples as Tim
harry_apples = tim_apples // 2  # Using integer division to avoid fractions

# Print the final answer
print(f"Harry has {harry_apples} apples.")
