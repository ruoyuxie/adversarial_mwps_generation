# Define the total number of heads and legs
total_heads_and_legs = 60

# Since we know that each emu has 1 head and 2 legs, we can write the following equation:
# number_of_emus + 2 * number_of_emus = total_heads_and_legs

# Let's solve for number_of_emus
# Combine like terms: 1 * number_of_emus + 2 * number_of_emus = 3 * number_of_emus
# So we have 3 * number_of_emus = total_heads_and_legs

# Divide both sides by 3 to find the number of emus
number_of_emus = total_heads_and_legs / 3

# Print the final answer
print(f"Farmer Brown has {int(number_of_emus)} emus in his flock.")
