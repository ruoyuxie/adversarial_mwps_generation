# Define the variables
price_per_chicken = 3  # dollars
number_of_chickens = 3
total_paid = 15  # dollars

# Calculate the total cost of the chickens
total_cost_of_chickens = price_per_chicken * number_of_chickens

# Calculate the cost of the potatoes
cost_of_potatoes = total_paid - total_cost_of_chickens

# Print the final answer
print("The potatoes cost:", cost_of_potatoes, "dollars")
