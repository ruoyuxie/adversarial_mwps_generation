# Define variables
total_earnings = 30  # Total earnings from selling cookies
cost_per_person = 2.5  # Cost per person to go to the pool
number_of_people = 10  # Number of people going

# Calculate the total cost for all people
total_cost = cost_per_person * number_of_people

# Calculate the amount left after paying for the pool
amount_left = total_earnings - total_cost

# Print the final answer
print("The amount left after going to the pool is $", amount_left)
