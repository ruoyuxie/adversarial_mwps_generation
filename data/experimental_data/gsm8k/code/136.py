# Define the variables based on the problem statement
# Laurie's number of shells
shells_laurie = 36

# Ben collected a third of what Laurie did
shells_ben = shells_laurie / 3

# Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did
shells_alan = shells_ben * 4

# Print the final answer
print(f"Alan collected {int(shells_alan)} shells.")
