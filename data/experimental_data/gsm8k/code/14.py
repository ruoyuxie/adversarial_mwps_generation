# Define the variables based on the given problem
weight_curl = 90  # weight Tony can lift with one arm in the curl exercise

# Calculate the weight Tony can lift in the military press
# It is twice the weight he can curl
weight_military_press = 2 * weight_curl

# Calculate the weight Tony can lift in the squat exercise
# It is five times the weight he can lift in the military press
weight_squat = 5 * weight_military_press

# Print the final answer
print(f"Tony can lift {weight_squat} pounds in the squat exercise.")
