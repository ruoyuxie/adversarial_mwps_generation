# Define the variables based on the problem statement
cost_of_computer = 400  # The cost of the computer in dollars
cost_of_printer = 40    # The cost of the printer in dollars
remaining_money = 10    # The money Delores has left in dollars

# Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer
total_cost = cost_of_computer + cost_of_printer

# Calculate the initial amount of money Delores had
# We know that after buying the computer and the printer, she has $10 left
# So, we add the remaining money to the total cost to find the initial amount
initial_money = total_cost + remaining_money

# Print the final answer
print("Delores had $" + str(initial_money) + " at first.")
