# Define the number of people in Willowdale city
willowdale_population = 2000

# Calculate the number of people in Roseville city
# Roseville city has 500 less than thrice as many people as Willowdale city
roseville_population = (3 * willowdale_population) - 500

# Calculate the number of people in Sun City
# Sun City has 1000 more than twice as many people as Roseville City
sun_city_population = (2 * roseville_population) + 1000

# Print the final answer
print("The number of people living in Sun City is:", sun_city_population)
