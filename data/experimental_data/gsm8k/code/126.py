# Define the variables
leo_fish_count = 40  # Leo's number of fish
agrey_extra_fish = 20  # Agrey caught 20 more fish than Leo

# Calculate the number of fish Agrey caught
agrey_fish_count = leo_fish_count + agrey_extra_fish

# Calculate the total number of fish they caught together
total_fish_count = leo_fish_count + agrey_fish_count

# Print the final answer
print("Total number of fish caught by Leo and Agrey:", total_fish_count)
