# Define the variables
total_candy_bars = 20
candy_bars_paid_by_dave = 6
cost_per_candy_bar = 1.50

# Calculate the number of candy bars John pays for
candy_bars_paid_by_john = total_candy_bars - candy_bars_paid_by_dave

# Calculate the total cost John pays
total_cost_paid_by_john = candy_bars_paid_by_john * cost_per_candy_bar

# Print the final answer
print(f"John paid ${total_cost_paid_by_john} for the candy bars.")
