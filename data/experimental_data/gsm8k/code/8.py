# Define the variables
connor_hourly_rate = 7.20  # Connor's hourly rate in dollars
sarah_multiplier = 5       # Sarah makes 5 times more per hour than Connor

# Calculate Sarah's hourly rate
sarah_hourly_rate = connor_hourly_rate * sarah_multiplier

# Define the number of hours Sarah works in a day
hours_worked = 8

# Calculate Sarah's earnings in an 8-hour day
sarah_daily_earnings = sarah_hourly_rate * hours_worked

# Print the final answer
print(f"Sarah makes ${sarah_daily_earnings} in an 8-hour day.")
