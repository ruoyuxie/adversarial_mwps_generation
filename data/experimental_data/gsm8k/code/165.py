# Define the cost of the old barbell
old_barbell_cost = 250

# Calculate the increase in cost (30% of the old barbell cost)
increase_in_cost = 0.30 * old_barbell_cost

# Calculate the cost of the new barbell (old cost + increase)
new_barbell_cost = old_barbell_cost + increase_in_cost

# Print the final answer
print("The new barbell cost:", new_barbell_cost)
