# Define the initial quantity of beef John buys
pounds_of_beef_bought = 4

# Calculate the amount of beef used in soup
pounds_of_beef_for_soup = pounds_of_beef_bought - 1

# Calculate the amount of vegetables used, which is twice the amount of beef used in soup
pounds_of_vegetables_used = 2 * pounds_of_beef_for_soup

# Print the final answer
print(f"John used {pounds_of_vegetables_used} pounds of vegetables.")
