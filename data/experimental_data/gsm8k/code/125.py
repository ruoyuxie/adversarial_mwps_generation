# Define the variables
gallons_per_day = 1.5  # John drinks 1.5 gallons of water a day
days_per_week = 7      # Number of days in a week
quarts_per_gallon = 4  # Number of quarts in a gallon

# Calculate the total gallons per week
gallons_per_week = gallons_per_day * days_per_week

# Convert gallons to quarts
quarts_per_week = gallons_per_week * quarts_per_gallon

# Print the final answer
print(f"John drinks {quarts_per_week} quarts of water a week.")
