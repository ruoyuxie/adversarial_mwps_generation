# Define the cost of all other Star Wars toys
cost_of_other_toys = 1000

# The lightsaber toy is twice as expensive as all other toys combined
cost_of_lightsaber = 2 * cost_of_other_toys

# Calculate the total amount spent by John
total_spent = cost_of_other_toys + cost_of_lightsaber

# Print the final answer
print("John has spent a total of $", total_spent, " after buying the lightsaber.", sep='')

# Alternatively, if you want to print just the number without the dollar sign:
# print(total_spent)
