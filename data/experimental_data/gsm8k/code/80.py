# Define the size of Farmer Brown's farm in acres
farmer_brown_acres = 200

# Calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm, which is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm
farmer_smith_acres = (2 * farmer_brown_acres) + 100

# Calculate the total acres of both farms combined
total_acres = farmer_brown_acres + farmer_smith_acres

# Print the final answer
print("The total acres of both farms together is:", total_acres)
