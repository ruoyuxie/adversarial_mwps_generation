# Define the cost of the first laptop
first_laptop_cost = 500

# Calculate the cost of the second laptop, which is 3 times the cost of the first laptop
second_laptop_cost = 3 * first_laptop_cost

# Calculate the total cost if Adam decides to buy both laptops
total_cost = first_laptop_cost + second_laptop_cost

# Print the final answer
