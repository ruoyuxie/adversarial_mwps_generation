# Define the variables based on the problem statement
earnings_per_4_hours = 28  # Nancy earns $28 for working 4 hours
target_earnings = 70       # The target amount Nancy wants to earn

# Calculate the earnings per hour
earnings_per_hour = earnings_per_4_hours / 4

# Calculate the number of hours needed to earn the target amount
hours_needed = target_earnings / earnings_per_hour

# Print the final answer
print(f"Nancy needs to work {hours_needed} hours to earn ${target_earnings}.")
