# Define the variable for the number of books Elmo has
elmo_books = 24

# According to the problem, Elmo has 3 times as many books as Laura
# So we can find the number of books Laura has by dividing Elmo's books by 3
laura_books = elmo_books / 3

# The problem also states that Laura has twice as many books as Stu
# So we can find the number of books Stu has by dividing Laura's books by 2
stu_books = laura_books / 2

# Print the final answer: the number of books Stu has
print("Stu has", int(stu_books), "books.")
