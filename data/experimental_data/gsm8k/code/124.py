# Define the variable for the number of blue gumballs
blue_gumballs = 12

# According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs
# Let's define a variable for the number of pink gumballs and calculate it
pink_gumballs = 4 * blue_gumballs + 22

# Now we have the number of pink gumballs, let's print the answer
print("The number of pink gumballs is:", pink_gumballs)
