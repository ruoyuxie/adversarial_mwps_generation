# Define the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday
chimichangas_tuesday = 125
chimichangas_wednesday = 125

# Define the number of chimichangas made on Friday, which is twice the amount made on Tuesday (or Wednesday)
chimichangas_friday = 2 * chimichangas_tuesday

# Calculate the total number of chimichangas made on those three days
total_chimichangas = chimichangas_tuesday + chimichangas_wednesday + chimichangas_friday

# Print the final answer
print("The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes a total of", total_chimichangas, "chimichangas on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.")
