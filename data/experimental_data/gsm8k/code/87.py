# Define the initial cost of the Magic card
initial_cost = 100

# The card triples in value, so calculate the new value
new_value = initial_cost * 3

# Calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost from the new value
profit = new_value - initial_cost

# Print the final answer
print("Mark's profit from selling the Magic card is $", profit)
