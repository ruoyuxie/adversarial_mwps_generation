# Define the variable for the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge
# Let's call it 'mugs'

# According to the problem, we have the equation:
# 8 + 4 * mugs = 40

# We can solve for 'mugs' by first subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation
# 4 * mugs = 40 - 8

# Now, we calculate the right side of the equation
right_side = 40 - 8

# Then, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for 'mugs'
# mugs = (40 - 8) / 4

# Calculate the number of mugs
mugs = right_side / 4
