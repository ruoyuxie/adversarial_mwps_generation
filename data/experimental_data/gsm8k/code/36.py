# Define the initial variables
children = 10
books_per_child = 7
additional_books = 8

# Calculate the total number of books before the teacher brings more
initial_total_books = children * books_per_child

# Calculate the final total number of books after the teacher brings more
final_total_books = initial_total_books + additional_books

# Print the final answer
print("The total number of books in the classroom is:", final_total_books)
