# Define the length of Brianne's yard
length_of_briannes_yard = 30

# According to the problem, Brianne's yard is 6 times the size of Alex's yard
# So, we can find the length of Alex's yard by dividing the length of Brianne's yard by 6
length_of_alexs_yard = length_of_briannes_yard / 6

# The problem also states that the length of Alex's yard is half the size of Derrick's yard
# Therefore, we can find the length of Derrick's yard by multiplying the length of Alex's yard by 2
length_of_derricks_yard = length_of_alexs_yard * 2

# Print the final answer
print(f"Derrick's yard is {length_of_derricks_yard} yards long.")
