# Define the variables based on the given problem
cumulonimbus_clouds = 3  # The number of cumulonimbus clouds

# Calculate the number of cumulus clouds
# It is given that there are 12 times as many cumulus clouds as cumulonimbus clouds
cumulus_clouds = 12 * cumulonimbus_clouds

# Calculate the number of cirrus clouds
# It is given that there are 4 times as many cirrus clouds as cumulus clouds
cirrus_clouds = 4 * cumulus_clouds

# Print the final answer
print(f"The number of cirrus clouds in the sky at this moment is: {cirrus_clouds}")
