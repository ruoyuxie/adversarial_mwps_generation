# Define the variables
dawns_cds = 10  # Dawn has 10 CDs
additional_cds = 7  # Kristine has 7 more CDs than Dawn

# Calculate the number of CDs Kristine has
kristines_cds = dawns_cds + additional_cds

# Calculate the total number of CDs they have together
total_cds = dawns_cds + kristines_cds

# Print the final answer
print("Together, Kristine and Dawn have", total_cds, "CDs.")
