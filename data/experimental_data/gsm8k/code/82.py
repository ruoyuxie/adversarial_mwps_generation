# Define the cost of the silverware
cost_of_silverware = 20

# Calculate the cost of the dinner plates as 50% of the cost of the silverware
cost_of_dinner_plates = 0.5 * cost_of_silverware

# Calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the silverware and the dinner plates
total_cost = cost_of_silverware + cost_of_dinner_plates

# Print the final answer
