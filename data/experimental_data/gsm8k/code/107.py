# Define the quantities
cards_for_christmas = 20
cards_for_birthday = 15
cost_per_card = 2

# Calculate the total number of cards
total_cards = cards_for_christmas + cards_for_birthday

# Calculate the total cost
total_cost = total_cards * cost_per_card

# Print the final answer
print("John spent a total of $", total_cost, " on thank you cards.", sep='')
