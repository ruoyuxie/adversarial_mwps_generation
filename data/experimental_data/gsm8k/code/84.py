# Define the number of blue, spotted fish
blue_spotted_fish = 10

# According to the problem, half of the blue fish have spots
# Therefore, the total number of blue fish is twice the number of blue, spotted fish
total_blue_fish = blue_spotted_fish * 2

# The problem states that one third of the fish in the tank are blue
# Therefore, the total number of fish is three times the number of blue fish
total_fish_in_tank = total_blue_fish * 3

# Print the final answer
print("There are", total_fish_in_tank, "fish in the tank.")
