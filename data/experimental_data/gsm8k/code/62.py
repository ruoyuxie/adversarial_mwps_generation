# Define the variables
units_per_semester = 20  # Number of units James takes per semester
cost_per_unit = 50       # Cost per unit in dollars
semesters = 2            # Number of semesters

# Calculate the cost per semester
cost_per_semester = units_per_semester * cost_per_unit

# Calculate the total cost for 2 semesters
total_cost = cost_per_semester * semesters

# Print the final answer
print("James pays $" + str(total_cost) + " for 2 semesters.")
