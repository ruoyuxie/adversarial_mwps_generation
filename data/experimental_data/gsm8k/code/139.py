# Define the number of paintings Samantha has
samantha_paintings = 27

# Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley
shelley_paintings = samantha_paintings + 12

# Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim
# Therefore, Kim has 8 paintings fewer than Shelley
kim_paintings = shelley_paintings - 8

# Print the number of paintings Kim has
print("Kim has", kim_paintings, "paintings.")
