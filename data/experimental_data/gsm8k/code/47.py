# Define the dimensions of the quilt in feet
length = 7  # in feet
width = 8   # in feet

# Define the cost per square foot
cost_per_square_foot = 40  # in dollars

# Calculate the area of the quilt
area = length * width  # in square feet

# Calculate the total cost of the quilt
total_cost = area * cost_per_square_foot  # in dollars

# Print the final answer
print("The cost of the quilt is:", total_cost)
