# Define the variables
total_cupcakes = 12
cost_per_cupcake = 1.50

# Calculate the total cost of the cupcakes
total_cost = total_cupcakes * cost_per_cupcake

# Since John and Steve split the costs evenly, divide the total cost by 2
cost_per_person = total_cost / 2

# Print the final answer
print("Each person paid $", cost_per_person)
