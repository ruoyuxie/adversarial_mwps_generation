# Define the variables
ounces_per_glass = 8  # ounces of milk in one glass
glasses_drunk_by_john = 2  # number of glasses John drinks
calories_per_ounce = 3  # calories per ounce of milk

# Calculate the total ounces of milk John drinks
total_ounces_drunk = ounces_per_glass * glasses_drunk_by_john

# Calculate the total calories consumed by John
total_calories_consumed = total_ounces_drunk * calories_per_ounce

# Print the final answer
print(f"John consumed {total_calories_consumed} calories.")
