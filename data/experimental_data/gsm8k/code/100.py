# Define the variables
number_of_toy_cars = 20
multiplier_for_toy_soldiers = 2

# Calculate the number of toy soldiers
number_of_toy_soldiers = number_of_toy_cars * multiplier_for_toy_soldiers

# Calculate the total number of toys
total_toys = number_of_toy_cars + number_of_toy_soldiers

# Print the final answer
print("James buys a total of", total_toys, "toys.")
