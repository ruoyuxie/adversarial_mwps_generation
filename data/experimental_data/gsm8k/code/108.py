# Define the amount John gets from his grandpa
amount_from_grandpa = 30

# Calculate the amount John gets from his grandma, which is 3 times the amount from his grandpa
amount_from_grandma = 3 * amount_from_grandpa

# Calculate the total amount John gets from both grandparents
total_amount = amount_from_grandpa + amount_from_grandma

# Print the final answer
print("John got a total of $", total_amount, " from his two grandparents.", sep='')
