# Define the variables based on the problem statement
number_of_country_cds = 23  # Henry has 23 country CDs

# According to the problem, Henry has 3 more country CDs than rock CDs
# Let's denote the number of rock CDs as 'number_of_rock_cds'
# Therefore, we can express the number of country CDs as:
# number_of_country_cds = number_of_rock_cds + 3

# We can rearrange the above equation to find the number of rock CDs
number_of_rock_cds = number_of_country_cds - 3

# The problem also states that Henry has twice as many rock CDs as classical CDs
# Let's denote the number of classical CDs as 'number_of_classical_cds'
# Therefore, we can express the number of rock CDs as:
# number_of_rock_cds = 2 * number_of_classical_cds

# We can rearrange the above equation to find the number of classical CDs
number_of_classical_cds = number_of_rock_cds // 2

# Now we can calculate the number of classical CDs
number_of_classical_cds = number_of_rock_cds // 2

# Print the final answer
print("Henry has", number_of_classical_cds, "classical CDs in his collection.")
