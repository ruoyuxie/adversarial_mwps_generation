# Define the variables
times_per_month = 2  # John volunteers twice a month
hours_per_time = 3   # Each time John volunteers for 3 hours
months_per_year = 12 # Number of months in a year

# Calculate the total hours volunteered per month
hours_per_month = times_per_month * hours_per_time

# Calculate the total hours volunteered per year
hours_per_year = hours_per_month * months_per_year

# Print the final answer
print("John volunteers", hours_per_year, "hours per year.")
