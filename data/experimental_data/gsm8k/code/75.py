# Define the quantities mentioned in the problem
apples = 14
oranges_per_dozen = 12
orange_dozen_count = 2

# Calculate the total number of oranges
total_oranges = oranges_per_dozen * orange_dozen_count

# Calculate how many more oranges there are than apples
more_oranges_than_apples = total_oranges - apples

# Print the final answer
print("Leif has", more_oranges_than_apples, "more oranges than apples.")
