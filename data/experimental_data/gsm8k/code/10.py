# Define the initial variables
initial_salary = 500  # Ruiz's initial monthly salary
raise_percentage = 6  # The percentage raise

# Calculate the raise amount
raise_amount = (raise_percentage / 100) * initial_salary

# Calculate the new salary
new_salary = initial_salary + raise_amount

# Print the final answer
print("Ruiz's new salary is $", new_salary)
