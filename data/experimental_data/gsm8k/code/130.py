# Define the number of books Darla has
darla_books = 6

# Katie has half as many books as Darla
katie_books = darla_books / 2

# Gary has 5 times the number of books that Darla and Katie have combined
gary_books = 5 * (darla_books + katie_books)

# Calculate the total number of books all three have
total_books = darla_books + katie_books + gary_books

# Print the final answer
print(f"The three have a total of {int(total_books)} books.")
