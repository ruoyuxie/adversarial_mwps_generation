# Define the variables
cost_of_heating_pad = 30  # The cost of the heating pad in dollars
uses_per_week = 3         # Number of times the heating pad is used in a week
number_of_weeks = 2       # Number of weeks the heating pad is used

# Calculate the total number of uses
total_uses = uses_per_week * number_of_weeks

# Calculate the cost per use
cost_per_use = cost_of_heating_pad / total_uses

# Print the final answer
print("The cost per use of the heating pad is $", cost_per_use)
