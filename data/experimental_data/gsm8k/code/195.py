# Define the variables based on the given problem
total_homework_time = 60  # Total time David spent on his homework
math_homework_time = 15   # Time spent on math homework
spelling_homework_time = 18  # Time spent on spelling homework

# Calculate the time spent reading by subtracting the time spent on math and spelling from the total time
reading_time = total_homework_time - math_homework_time - spelling_homework_time

# Print the final answer
print(f"David spent {reading_time} minutes reading for his daily reading log.")
