# Define the number of shirts Hazel received
hazel_shirts = 6

# Razel received twice the number of shirts as Hazel
razel_shirts = hazel_shirts * 2

# Calculate the total number of shirts they have together
total_shirts = hazel_shirts + razel_shirts

# Print the final answer
print("Hazel and Razel have a total of", total_shirts, "shirts.")
