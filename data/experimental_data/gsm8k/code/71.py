# Define the number of carnations in each bouquet
first_bouquet = 9
second_bouquet = 14
third_bouquet = 13

# Calculate the total number of carnations
total_carnations = first_bouquet + second_bouquet + third_bouquet

# Calculate the number of bouquets
number_of_bouquets = 3

# Calculate the average number of carnations per bouquet
average_carnations = total_carnations / number_of_bouquets

# Print the final answer
print("The average number of carnations in the bouquets is:", average_carnations)
