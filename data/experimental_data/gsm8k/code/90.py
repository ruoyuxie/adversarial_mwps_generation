# Define the variable for the number of buttons Mari made
buttons_mari = 8

# Kendra made 4 more than five times as many decorated buttons as Mari
buttons_kendra = 5 * buttons_mari + 4

# Sue made half as many as Kendra
buttons_sue = buttons_kendra // 2

# Print the final answer
print("Sue made", buttons_sue, "buttons.")
