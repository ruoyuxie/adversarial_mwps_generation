# Define the quantity of water in one jug
water_per_jug = 5  # liters

# Define the number of jugs in one bucket
jugs_per_bucket = 4

# Calculate the total amount of water in one bucket
water_per_bucket = water_per_jug * jugs_per_bucket

# Define the number of buckets
number_of_buckets = 2

# Calculate the total amount of water in the given number of buckets
total_water = water_per_bucket * number_of_buckets

# Print the final answer
print(f"The total amount of water in {number_of_buckets} buckets is {total_water} liters.")
