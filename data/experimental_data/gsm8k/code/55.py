# Define variables
carla_age_in_6_years = 30  # Carla's age in 6 years
sum_of_ages_now = 55       # Sum of Carla's and Louis's current ages

# Calculate Carla's current age
carla_current_age = carla_age_in_6_years - 6

# Calculate Louis's current age
louis_current_age = sum_of_ages_now - carla_current_age

# Print the final answer
print("Louis is currently", louis_current_age, "years old.")
