# Define the number of kids who came to the cookout in 2004
kids_2004 = 60

# In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004
kids_2005 = kids_2004 / 2

# In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005
kids_2006 = (2 / 3) * kids_2005

# Calculate the number of kids who came to the cookout in 2006
# Since we want a whole number of kids, we'll round down to the nearest integer
kids_2006 = int(kids_2006)

# Print the final answer
print(f"The number of kids who came to the cookout in 2006 is: {kids_2006}")
