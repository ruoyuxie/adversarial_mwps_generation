# Define the variables
cost_of_new_bedroom_set = 3000
sale_of_old_bedroom_set = 1000
monthly_interest_rate = 0.10  # 10% monthly interest rate

# Calculate the remaining amount after selling the old bedroom set
remaining_amount = cost_of_new_bedroom_set - sale_of_old_bedroom_set

# Calculate the monthly payment due to the interest rate
monthly_payment = remaining_amount * monthly_interest_rate

# Print the final answer
print(f"Tom has to pay ${monthly_payment} per month for the new bedroom set.")
