# Define the size of Peter's locker
peters_locker_size = 5  # in cubic inches

# According to the problem, Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker
# Let's find the size of Zack's locker
zacks_locker_size = peters_locker_size * 4  # Multiply by 4 to get the full size

# The problem states that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker
# So, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker
timothys_locker_size = zacks_locker_size * 2  # Multiply by 2 to get the full size

# Print the final answer
print("Timothy's locker is", timothys_locker_size, "cubic inches.")
