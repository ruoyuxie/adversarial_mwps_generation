# Define the variables based on the problem statement
spent_on_drink = 1.75  # dollars spent on the first drink
spent_on_other = 1.25  # dollars spent on another item
remaining_money = 6.00  # dollars Josh had left

# Calculate the total amount spent
total_spent = spent_on_drink + spent_on_other

# Calculate the initial amount of money Josh had
initial_money = remaining_money + total_spent

# Print the final answer
print("Josh had $" + str(initial_money) + " at first.")
