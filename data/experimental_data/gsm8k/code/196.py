# Define the number of cookies Suzanne made
suzanne_cookies = 36

# Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made
josh_cookies = suzanne_cookies / 4

# Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh
# "Two times more" means three times as many, because it's two times more plus the original amount
kelsie_cookies = josh_cookies * 3

# Print the final answer
print(f"Kelsie made {int(kelsie_cookies)} cookies.")
