# Define the variables based on the problem statement
arnold_jellybeans = 5  # Arnold has 5 jellybeans

# Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee, so we can find the number of jellybeans Lee has
lee_jellybeans = 2 * arnold_jellybeans  # Multiply by 2 because Arnold has half as many

# Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee, so we can calculate the number of jellybeans Tino has
tino_jellybeans = lee_jellybeans + 24  # Add 24 to the number of jellybeans Lee has

# Print the final answer
print(f"Tino has {tino_jellybeans} jellybeans.")
