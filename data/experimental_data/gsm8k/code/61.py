# Define the variable for Peter's weight
peter_weight = 65

# Since Peter weighs half as much as Tyler, we can find Tyler's weight
tyler_weight = peter_weight * 2

# Tyler weighs 25 pounds more than Sam, so we can find Sam's weight
# by subtracting 25 from Tyler's weight
sam_weight = tyler_weight - 25

# Print the final answer: Sam's weight
print("Sam weighs", sam_weight, "pounds.")
