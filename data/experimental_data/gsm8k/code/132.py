# Define the variables
total_slices = 8
calories_per_slice = 300

# Calculate the number of slices Bob eats
slices_eaten = total_slices / 2

# Calculate the total calories consumed by Bob
total_calories_consumed = slices_eaten * calories_per_slice

# Print the final answer
print(f"Bob ate {total_calories_consumed} calories.")
