# Define the variables based on the problem statement
jacob_cats = 90  # Jacob has 90 cats

# Annie has three times fewer cats than Jacob
# This means Annie has 1/3 the number of cats Jacob has
annie_cats = jacob_cats // 3

# Melanie has twice as many cats as Annie
melanie_cats = 2 * annie_cats

# Print the final answer
print("Melanie has", melanie_cats, "cats.")
