# Define the variables
dina_dolls = 60  # Dina's total number of dolls

# Calculate the number of dolls Ivy has
ivy_dolls = dina_dolls / 2  # Ivy has half the number of dolls as Dina

# Calculate the number of collector's edition dolls Ivy has
collectors_edition_fraction = 2 / 3
ivy_collectors_edition_dolls = ivy_dolls * collectors_edition_fraction

# Print the final answer
print(f"Ivy has {ivy_collectors_edition_dolls} collector's edition dolls.")
