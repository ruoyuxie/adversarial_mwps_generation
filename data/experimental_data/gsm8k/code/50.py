# Define the length of the full-size Mustang
full_size_mustang_length = 240  # in inches

# Calculate the length of the mid-size model (1/10th the size of the full-size)
mid_size_model_length = full_size_mustang_length / 10

# Calculate the length of the smallest model (half the size of the mid-size model)
smallest_model_length = mid_size_model_length / 2

# Print the final answer
print(f"The smallest model mustang is {smallest_model_length} inches long.")
