# Define the variables based on the given problem
earnings_for_3_hours = 45  # Alani earned $45 for 3 hours
desired_earnings = 75      # Alani wants to earn $75

# Calculate the rate of earnings per hour
rate_per_hour = earnings_for_3_hours / 3

# Calculate the number of hours needed to earn the desired amount
hours_needed = desired_earnings / rate_per_hour

# Print the final answer
print(f"Alani would need to baby-sit for {hours_needed} hours to earn $75.")
