# Define the variables
widgets_per_hour = 20  # John can make 20 widgets in an hour
hours_per_day = 8      # John works for 8 hours a day
days_per_week = 5      # John works 5 days a week

# Calculate the number of widgets made in a day
widgets_per_day = widgets_per_hour * hours_per_day

# Calculate the total number of widgets made in a week
widgets_per_week = widgets_per_day * days_per_week

# Print the final answer
print(f"John makes {widgets_per_week} widgets in a week.")
