# Define the total number of fish in the tank
total_fish = 30

# Calculate the number of blue fish, which is one third of the total fish
blue_fish = total_fish // 3

# Calculate the number of blue fish with spots, which is half of the blue fish
blue_spotted_fish = blue_fish // 2

# Print the final answer
print("The number of blue, spotted fish in the tank is:", blue_spotted_fish)
