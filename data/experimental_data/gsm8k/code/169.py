# Define the variables
number_of_trees = 5  # Tim grows 5 trees
lemons_per_tree_per_year = 6  # Each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree
years_in_a_decade = 10  # A decade has 10 years

# Calculate the total number of lemons collected in a year
lemons_per_year = number_of_trees * lemons_per_tree_per_year

# Calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade
total_lemons_in_a_decade = lemons_per_year * years_in_a_decade

# Print the final answer
print("Tim gets", total_lemons_in_a_decade, "lemons in a decade.")
