# Define the variables
amount_borrowed = 1200  # Amount Jack borrowed from Jill
interest_rate = 0.10    # Interest rate (10%)

# Calculate the interest
interest = amount_borrowed * interest_rate

# Calculate the total amount to be paid back
total_payback = amount_borrowed + interest

# Print the final answer
print("Jack will pay back:", total_payback)
