# Define initial variables
todds_money = 20  # Todd's initial amount of money in dollars
candy_bar_cost = 2  # Cost of one candy bar in dollars
number_of_candy_bars = 4  # Number of candy bars Todd buys

# Calculate the total cost of the candy bars
total_candy_cost = candy_bar_cost * number_of_candy_bars

# Calculate the remaining money Todd has after buying the candy bars
todd_remaining_money = todds_money - total_candy_cost

# Print the final answer
print("Todd has", todd_remaining_money, "dollars left.")
