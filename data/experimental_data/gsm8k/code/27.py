# Define the number of votes Randy got
votes_randy = 16

# Calculate the number of votes Shaun got (5 times Randy's votes)
votes_shaun = 5 * votes_randy

# Calculate the number of votes Eliot got (twice Shaun's votes)
votes_eliot = 2 * votes_shaun

# Print the final answer
print("Eliot got", votes_eliot, "votes.")
