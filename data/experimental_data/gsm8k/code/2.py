# Define the variables
number_of_fish = 3
cost_per_fish_per_day = 1
days_in_may = 31

# Calculate the daily cost for all fish
daily_cost_for_all_fish = number_of_fish * cost_per_fish_per_day

# Calculate the total cost for the month of May
total_cost_for_may = daily_cost_for_all_fish * days_in_may

# Print the final answer
print("Jen spends", total_cost_for_may, "on food in the month of May.")
