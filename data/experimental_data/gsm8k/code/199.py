# Define the number of video games Tory has
tory_video_games = 6

# Calculate the number of video games Julia has (a third of Tory's)
julia_video_games = tory_video_games / 3

# Calculate the number of video games Theresa has (5 more than thrice Julia's)
theresa_video_games = 3 * julia_video_games + 5

# Print the final answer
print("Theresa has", int(theresa_video_games), "video games.")
