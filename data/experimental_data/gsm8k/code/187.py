# Define the number of students in each of the first three groups
group1 = 5
group2 = 8
group3 = 7

# Define the total number of students
total_students = 24

# Calculate the number of students in the fourth group
# by subtracting the sum of the first three groups from the total number of students
group4 = total_students - (group1 + group2 + group3)

# Print the final answer
print("The number of students in the fourth group is:", group4)
