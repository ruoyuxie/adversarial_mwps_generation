# Define the variables based on the given problem
darlenes_mpg = 20  # Darlene's car gets 20 miles per gallon
marthas_mpg = darlenes_mpg / 2  # Martha's car gets half as many miles per gallon

# Calculate the number of gallons Martha's car requires for a 300-mile trip
trip_distance = 300  # The distance of the trip in miles

# The formula to calculate the gallons needed is: gallons = distance / miles_per_gallon
marthas_gallons_needed = trip_distance / marthas_mpg

# Print the final answer
print(f"Martha's car requires {marthas_gallons_needed} gallons to make a 300-mile trip.")
