# Define the number of rehabilitation centers Lisa visited
lisa_centers = 6

# Calculate the number of rehabilitation centers Jude visited
# Jude visited half fewer rehabilitation centers as Lisa did
jude_centers = lisa_centers / 2

# Calculate the number of rehabilitation centers Han visited
# Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did
han_centers = (2 * jude_centers) - 2

# Calculate the number of rehabilitation centers Jane visited
# Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han
jane_centers = (2 * han_centers) + 6

# Calculate the total number of rehabilitation centers they all visited
total_centers = lisa_centers + jude_centers + han_centers + jane_centers

# Print the final answer
print(f"Total rehabilitation centers visited: {total_centers}")
